# MovieApp

## Introduction
This application shows a movie search engine that shows a list with the results. When you click on an item, a new page shows you the movie's description. Everything is built with [**Ionic**](https://ionicframework.com/) and [**Angular**](https://angular.io/) frameworks, and all is connected to [**OMDb**](http://www.omdbapi.com/) Api, an open movie database.
